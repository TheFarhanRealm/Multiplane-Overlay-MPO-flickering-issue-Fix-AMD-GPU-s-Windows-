# Multiplane-Overlay-MPO-flickering-issue-Fix-AMD-GPU-s-Windows-
It’s a Windows display feature called Multiplane Overlay (MPO) that sometimes bugs out on AMD GPUs. This .reg file will most likely fix the issue.

Run "DisableMPO.Reg"
Your done.

I also left a commands.txt if you want to undo it or otherwise.
